Our application aims to address four common automobile-related issues. 

Firstly, the frustration of being blocked by another car in a parking lot is a significant concern for drivers. 
Secondly, the hindrance to smooth traffic flow caused by improperly parked cars presents a safety issue. 
Thirdly, in the event of an accidental collision, locating the car owner for insurance claims becomes a challenge. 
Lastly, the inconvenience of charging an electric car is exacerbated when fully charged vehicles occupy charging stations for an extended period.

To resolve these issues, we plan to utilize QR codes affixed to cars, allowing users to scan them and notify owners about the specific problems.
Additionally, we intend to implement a "sell the car" feature for those interested in selling their vehicles through the application.
